# shs
## What is shs?
This is my first Open-Source program. 
The acronym shs stands for SHellSuperior, 
because this will be a very powerful program 
to use your terminal in a new way

## Ok, but what does it do?
My actual idea is to develop a GUI which can manage
your local shells, your remote ssh(s), be used as a
Serial Monitor, transform many CLI utilities to GUI utilities.
And many other things that will surely come to my mind!
